### Setup

1. `cp src/Auth/sample.auth0-variables.js src/Auth/auth0-variables.js`
2. Edit the variables with the appropriate values
3. `npm install && npm start`

Currently this app does little else besides let you login via auth0 and then
makes a hardcoded request to our API to test it out.

But, the basic mechanism works so it's a starting point.
