what
---

This manages membership at Austin DSA. Specifically this app intends to keep
track of:

- Active members
- Committees
- Meetings of said committees
- Attendance at said meetings

Additionally, by integrating Auth0, additional services we bring online can use
this database for authentication and / or authorization.

As of now this is intended but perhaps not material. Yet.

setup
---

See the respective `README.md` files in `server` and `client` for the
information you'd reasonably expect to see here.

**TODO** how did you configure Auth0? That's important!
